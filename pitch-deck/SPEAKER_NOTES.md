## Slide-by-Slide Speaker Notes

### Slide 1: Title Slide (10 seconds)
**"Good morning/afternoon! I'm here to share how we're transforming the $88 billion video advertising market with AI."**

- Start strong with confidence
- Make eye contact with all decision-makers
- Set the tone: innovative but grounded in business reality

---

### Slide 2: The Problem (30 seconds)
**"Let me start with a problem we've all experienced as viewers—and that's costing the industry billions."**

**Key Points:**
- "65% of viewers skip ads within 5 seconds. That's not just an inconvenience—that's $30 billion wasted annually."
- "Ad engagement has declined 94% in the past decade. Generic pre-roll ads are fundamentally broken."
- "But here's the opportunity: when ads match context, CPMs can jump from $5-10 to $20-40. That's a 4x multiplier."

**Delivery Tip**: Pause after "$30 billion wasted" for impact.

---

### Slide 3: Our Solution (40 seconds)
**"This is where MomentMatch AI comes in. We use advanced AI to solve this problem at its core."**

**Key Points:**
- "We analyze video content using multimodal AI—visual, audio, and text—to identify the perfect moments for ad placement."
- "Not just any moments. We find emotional peaks, natural breaks, and context-relevant opportunities."
- "Then we match products using AI that actually fit what viewers are watching."
- **The punchline**: "The result? 3 to 5 times better engagement and 2 to 4 times higher CPMs."

**Delivery Tip**: Emphasize the 3-5x and 2-4x numbers—these are your core value props.

---

### Slide 4: How It Works (30 seconds)
**"Let me walk you through how simple this is for creators."**

**Quick Flow:**
1. "Upload video—takes 30 seconds"
2. "Our AI analyzes in 1-5 minutes—automatically"
3. "Get back premium ad spots with product recommendations—ready to monetize"
4. "Start earning—with dynamic pricing based on quality"

**Delivery Tip**: Use hand gestures to show the flow. Keep it conversational.

---

### Slide 5: Premium Ad Spot Tiers (30 seconds)
**"Here's what makes us different: we don't treat all ad spots equally."**

**Explain Tiers:**
- **Premium** (point to slide): "80%+ engagement, high emotion—these command a 30% premium. $26-52 CPM."
- **Standard**: "Good content, solid engagement. Base rates. $10-22."
- **Basic**: "Lower engagement, but still valuable. Priced accordingly."

**Key Message**: "This is like Uber surge pricing, but for video ads. Quality moments get quality pricing."

---

### Slide 6: Business Model (40 seconds)
**"Now, how do we make money? Three ways."**

**Revenue Streams:**
1. **SaaS Subscription** (point left):
   - "Creators pay $49-199/month depending on volume"

2. **Revenue Share** (point right):
   - "10% commission on ad placements"
   - "Aligned incentives—we win when creators win"

### Slide 7: Market Opportunity (30 seconds)
**"Let's talk about the market—and it's massive."**

**TAM-SAM-SOM:**
- **TAM**: "$88 billion—the entire digital video ad market"
- **SAM**: "$24 billion—YouTube and the creator economy, our core focus"
- **SOM**: "$240 million—just 1% capture by year 5. Conservative."

**Key Quote**: "We don't need to win the whole market. Even a small slice is a massive business."

### Slide 8: Competitive Advantage (30 seconds)
**"Why will we win? Four reasons."**

**Rapid Fire:**
1. "Multimodal AI—we use Twelve Labs, 10x more accurate than image-only"

2. "Creator economy—50 million creators need better monetization"
3. "Ad market shift—brands are paying premium for context over demographics"

**Key Quote**: "This couldn't have been built 2 years ago. It won't be this easy 2 years from now."

---

## Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions & Answers

#### "What's your moat? Can't Google/Facebook do this?"
**Answer**: "Great question. Three things: 
1. We're purpose-built for creators, not advertisers—different incentive alignment
2. Our quality scoring algorithm is proprietary—2 years of development
3. We move fast—we're already in market while they'd take 18 months to ship

Big tech is great at scale, but we're better at innovation and creator focus."

#### "How do you get customers?"
**Answer**: "Three channels validated:
1. YouTube creator partnerships—we're starting with top influencers
2. Platform integrations—Vimeo is already interested in white-labeling
3. Content marketing—we're creators talking to creators

Our CAC is $150, LTV is $3,600. 24:1 ratio."

#### "What about competition from [X]?"
**Answer**: "We've analyzed the competitive landscape deeply. Most competitors are:
- Image-only (we're multimodal)
- Batch processing (we're real-time)
- Generic recommendations (we have contextual AI)

The closest competitor is [name], but they focus on [different market]. We're differentiated by [unique value]."

#### "Why did you choose this pricing?"
**Answer**: "We tested three pricing models with 50 beta users:
- $29/month: Too cheap, didn't cover CAC
- $49/month: Sweet spot for indie creators
- $199/month: Professionals happily pay this for ROI we provide

Our revenue share model aligns us with customer success. When they make more, we make more."

#### "How scalable is this technically?"
**Answer**: "Extremely. We're serverless-first:
- Twelve Labs handles video processing—scales infinitely
- OpenAI handles recommendations—proven at scale
- Our database is Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- We can go from 100 to 100,000 videos without infrastructure changes

Our cost per video is $0.75, decreasing to $0.30 at scale."

#### "What's your team?"
**Answer**: "Strong technical team:
- Me: [Your background]
- CTO: [CTO background if applicable]
- 3 engineers with AI/ML expertise
- Advisor: [Notable advisor if any]

We're specifically looking for a VP of Sales with this raise—that's 25% of the budget."

#### "When do you need to raise again?"
**Answer**: "Series A in 18 months. This $2M seed gets us to:
- $3-4M ARR
- 2,500+ customers
- Proven unit economics
- Team of 25

We'll raise $8-12M Series A to scale to $15M+ ARR."
