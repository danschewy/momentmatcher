**For Ad Moments (from Twelve Labs analysis):**

- `engagementScore = emotionIntensity * 0.6 + confidence * 0.4`
- `attentionScore = confidence * 0.7 + emotionIntensity * 0.3`
- Requires high emotion (excited, thrilled, energetic, passionate) AND high confidence

**For Brand Mentions:**

- Ad opportunities get "excited" emotion ‚Üí typically premium tier
- Brand mentions get "positive" emotion ‚Üí typically standard tier
- Both use 75% default confidence

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see premium spots:

2. **Video content matters**:

   - Premium spots need high emotion (excited, energetic, passionate)
   - AND high confidence in the detection
   - Low-energy or calm videos may not generate premium spots

3. **Brand mentions vs Ad moments**:

   - "Ad opportunities" in brand mentions ‚Üí usually premium
   - "Brand mentions" ‚Üí usually standard
   - Ad moments from Twelve Labs ‚Üí depends on video content

4. **Re-analyze if needed**:
   - Delete the video analysis from database
   - Re-analyze to recalculate spot quality
   - New analysis will use latest spot calculator logic
